# Task 4 - Git Workflow (Task4-Repo)

This repo demonstrates Git branching workflow using **main**, **dev**, and **feature** branches.

## Branches
- **main** → Default branch containing the base README.
- **dev** → Development branch containing `dev.py`.
- **feature** → Feature branch containing `feature.py`.

## Files
- `README.md` (in main branch) → Project description.  
- `dev.py` (in dev branch) → Sample Python code.  
- `feature.py` (in feature branch) → New feature Python code.  

## Workflow Steps
1. Created repository `Task4-Git-Workflow`.  
2. Added three branches: `main`, `dev`, `feature`.  
3. Added respective files in each branch.  
4. Verified branches and files on GitHub.  


## Proof of Work
- **Screenshot 1** → Branches dropdown showing `main`, `dev`, `feature`.  
- **Screenshot 2** → `README.md` file in `main`.  
- **Screenshot 3** → `dev.py` file in `dev`.  
- **Screenshot 4** → `feature.py` file in `feature`.
